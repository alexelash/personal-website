   I've worked at the intersection of design and technology for nearly a decade and have had the opportunity to collaborate with accomplished professionals in many different capacities. I take great pride in fostering collaboration to produce distinct brand identities, high-converting ads, marketing campaigns, and inclusive aand performant digital experiences. Guiding and mentoring teams has also been a fulfilling aspect of my journey.

   Over my career, I have stayed involved in my community through co-organizing and co-teaching affordable tech classes, teaching an Interactive course at my alma mater, participating in hackathon events, and supporting local non-profit organizations with pro bono work. I've worked for a diverse array of clients and industries united by a common purpose: unique, beautiful and impactful tech that prioritizes inclusivity and upholds a human-centered approach.
