   I've worked at the intersection of design and technology for nearly a decade. Over that time, I have had the opportunity to work across different business sectors alongside some of the most accomplished professionals in the industry. My work has focused around designing distinct brand identities, inclusive and engaging digital experiences, and unique sales and marketing collateral. Guiding and mentoring teams, both formally and informally, has also been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my career.

   Over my career, I have stayed involved in my community through co-organizing and co-teaching affordable tech classes, teaching an Interactive course at my alma mater, participating in hackathon events, and supporting local non-profit organizations with pro bono work. I've worked for a diverse array of clients and industries united by a common purpose: unique, beautiful and impactful tech that prioritizes inclusivity and upholds a human-centered approach.
