   For nine years, I've worked at the intersection of design and technology. As the Creative Director at [Administrate](https://www.getadministrate.com), I work with a talented team of marketers, copywriters, and developers. I lead the Brand Experience Team and work with my colleagues to develop high-converting, creative ads and marketing campaigns; a performant and delightful web experience; and competitive visual identity and brand.  

    Though I'll always be a Philly girl, I fell in love with Scotland while traveling and have made Edinburgh my home. In my free time, I have co-organized and co-taught low-cost classes for women in tech; taught an Interactive class at my alma mater; helped organize hackathons; and worked for local non-profits. 

    In my spare time I love to draw, play guitar, cook, and tell my cat what a good boy he is.
