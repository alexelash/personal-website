   My creative home is the sweet spot where design meets logistics. I'm the kind of designer who color-codes project timelines and gets a rush from a perfectly executed launch. Detail-obsessed and passionate about creating work that _does_ good as much as it _looks_ good.

   Now a Creative Director at a tech company, I have over a decade of experience working at the intersection of design and technology across diverse business sectors. Mentoring teammates (formally and informally) has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my career, but community work keeps me grounded. Over the years I've used my free time to teach affordable coding and design classes, foster cats, and support local nonprofits with volunteer work.
