   I've worked somewhere at the intersection of design and technology for over a decade. During that time, I have had the opportunity to work across a broad variation of business sectors. My work has primarily focused around crafting brand and digital experiences. Guiding and mentoring members of my team, both formally and informally, has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of my career.

   Staying connected to my local community is important to me. Over the years, I've taught affordable tech classes, fostered cats, and supported non-profit organizations with volunteer work.
