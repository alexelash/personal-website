      Administrate is on a mission to transform corporate learning technology infrastructure, catering to enterprises seeking cutting-edge training solutions. Our commitment to excellence and innovation compelled us to initiate a comprehensive rebranding effort, aimed at harmonizing our the visual identity with our messaging and brand personality. The goal was to develop a new brand identity and logo that would convey our position as a company innovating in a space filled with veteran companies. 

      In addition to building best-in-its-class software, Administrate has strong values and a mission to develop an organization that has people and community at its center. Decisions around visual and written expressions of the brand aimed to be faithful to company culture.

      The new logo is a combination trademark, with a mark that is designed to be asymmetrical in order to convey innovation. The symbol contained within the full trademark symbolizes our dynamic nature, through a sleek, abstract representation of the letter “A” that emphasizes our commitment to progress. This symbol also marks a significant departure from our old emblem which was more static and simply set in the brand typeface, Inter. The three stems of the abstracted “A” in the logomark shoot up and to the right, meeting in the center, symbolizing how Administrate unifies disparate systems, functions, and tools in enterprise training.

      The logotype was based off of the typeface Söhne, but was customized to connect it to the mark visually. It is a “solid, confident” typeface with close spacing, low contrast, and humanist qualities. Söhne was intentially chosen for the wordmark in order to temper the daring, and excitable tones of our logomark with competence and clarity.

      Continuing to prioritize developing recognizability in our market, we decided to use a branded house approach for subbranding.

    title: 'Color'

      One of the most notable changes of the new brand identity was shifting from using blue as a primary brand color to purple. Our core color of Core Purple highlights our role as the changemaker in our industry and differentiates the company from competitors. Blue was shifted to a supporting role, but remains a vital aspect of our visual communication. A set of vibrant, supporting accent colors have also been introduced to the palette.

      This project underscored the importance of comprehensive research, a clear creative vision, early and frequent involvement of leadership, and rigorous implementation. Though I was the primary designer implementing the new brand identity, I would be remiss in not mentioning all of the important brand strategy and messaging work that had been recently completed on the Marketing Team, and which I aimed to faithfully express visually.

      We announced these changes to the company, and I got to work on a roll-out plan across our various brand touchpoints. Detailed guidelines and instructions played a pivotal role in ensuring consistency and adoption. I worked with the Administrate team to help prioritize key needs, and got to work updating email signatures, social media templates, advertisements, swag, trade show booth assets, and much more.
