    For nine years, I've worked at the intersection of design and technology and have worked on product and brand. I currently work as Creative Director at [Administrate](https://www.getadministrate.com). 

    IThough I'm a Philly girl, I fell in love with Scotland while traveling and have decided to make Edinburgh my home. In my free time, I have co-organized and co-taught low-cost classes for women in tech; taught an Interactive class at my alma mater; helped organize the hackathons; and worked for local non-profits. 

    In my spare time I love to draw, play guitar, cook, and tell my cat what a good boy he is.
