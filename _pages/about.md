   Over my career, I've worked at the intersection of design and technology. As the Creative Director at [Administrate](https://www.getadministrate.com), I’ve had the privilege of working with a talented team of marketers, copywriters, and developers. People management is something I genuinely enjoy, and I take pride in guiding the Brand Experience Team to collaboratively create high-converting, imaginative advertisements and marketing campaigns, a web experience that's both performant and delightful, and a competitive visual identity and brand.

    Although I'll always have a soft spot for my hometown of Philly, my heart found a new home in Scotland during my travels, where I've happily settled in Edinburgh. In my free time, I have co-organized and co-taught low-cost classes for women in tech; taught an Interactive class at my alma mater; helped organize hackathons; and worked for local non-profits. 

    In my spare time I love to draw, play guitar, cook, and tell my cat what a good boy he is.
